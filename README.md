# Gifs-App

This is the GitHub repository for this project I made to search GIF's, based on **Angular** and using the **GIPHY API** from https://developers.giphy.com/

It also save the last 10 search queries in a **local storage** variable called *historial*, and it uses some CSS3 Animations to showing the results.

#### Now it's deployed here https://gifs-app-tcp.netlify.app/
